## Notes
- Selenium Chrome Driver must have the same version than your Chrome (change the lib version in the project if required)
- Don't be evil, else Instagram will delete your spamming account
- The solution is micro-service oriented, but Instagram will detected the spamming account if the bot is too fast
- If you want to publish without remote Selenium, add _PUBLISH_CHROMEDRIVER in the DefineConstants of the .csproj
- The account should follow at last one account, else the bot will fail to detect this
- About "Unusual Login Attempt Detected" : If the bot connect from a location, OS, Browser that you never used before, you will get this email code chalenge. Pass it before lauching the bot again. You can change the OS/Browser (Chrome/Windows 10 by default) with the --user-agent in the SeleniumBrowserArguments setting.
## TODO :
- Update this readme for all function now working :-)
- Enable more functions already working on the Flickr version of this bot
- Like pict found and add follow the account by default
